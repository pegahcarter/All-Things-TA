#### Thoughts for funding
- Only real remaining work to get ATTA/WC profitable is on my end
- I have been spending ~20 hrs a week on this project
- Work load has been proportionally higher on my end
- Total payment: .2 BTC / $2,000


#### Fee Structure
- Options
  - 6 months - .035 BTC
  - Lifetime - .055 BTC



#### ATTA Earning Potential
- Insiders: 183 total members - 150 "real" members
  - Let's assume 10% of members renew for 6 months, and 5% renew for a lifetime
    - 6 month revenue = 150 members * 10% * .035 = .525 BTC
    - Lifetime revenue = 150 members * 5% * .055 = .413 BTC
    __- Total:  .938 BTC__
- Free: 2,923 total members - 2,500 "real" members
  - Let's assume 2% of subscribe for 6 months, and 1% subscribe for a lifetime
    - 6 month revenue = 2,500 members * 2% * .035 = 1.75 BTC
    - Lifetime revenue = 2,500 members * 1% * .055 = 1.375 BTC
    __- Total: 3.125 BTC__
__- Net Profit: .938 BTC + 3.125 BTC = 4.063 BTC__



#### Order of Execution
1. Fix & improve WC/ATTA signals immediately
2. Start generating income from WC/ATTA
