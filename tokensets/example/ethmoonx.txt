Moonshot is an automated strategy that buys when RSI and volatility is high, sells
when RSI and volatility is low, and otherwise holds its current position.

Moonshot was given its name due to the fact that attempts to join strong bull trends
that are starting to break out.  This strategy does not try to catch every small-medium
price swing.

I expect Moonshot to potentially underperform a buy-and-hold strategy in strongly
bullish and sideways/choppy markets and overperform in bearish markets.  This strategy
is designed to win the long game by holding a long position during strong bull markets,
selling when the trend looks to be breaking down, and then buying back at a discount
after the bear trend ends.   This is the pronounced compounding effects that can
be seen in the backtest data.  This strategy also produced much lower portfolio
volatility that a buy-and-hold.

ETH Moonshot X uses the Moonshot algorithm with parameters that worked better with
ETH in backtesting.

DISCLAIMER: While this strategies backtesting results were very promising, it is
important to understand that it has little live trading history.  By buying this
set you are assuming the typical risk that is associated with any untested strategy.
