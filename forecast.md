#### Current ATTA Fee Structure

- Options
  - 6 months - .035 BTC
  - Lifetime - .055 BTC


#### ATTA Earning Potential

- Insiders: 183 total members - 150 "real" members
  - Assume 10% of members renew for 6 months, and 5% renew for a lifetime
    - 6 month revenue = 150 members * 10% * .035 = .525 BTC
    - Lifetime revenue = 150 members * 5% * .055 = .413 BTC
    __- Total:  .938 BTC__
- Free: 2,923 total members - 2,500 "real" members
  - Assume 4% subscribe for 6 months, and 2% subscribe for a lifetime
    - 6 month revenue = 2,500 members * 4% * .035 = 3.5 BTC
    - Lifetime revenue = 2,500 members * 2% * .055 = 2.75 BTC
    __- Total: 6.25 BTC__

__- Net Profit: .938 BTC + 6.5 BTC = 7.188 BTC or 1.8 BTC each__


#### General thoughts
- Only real remaining work to get ATTA/WC profitable is on Carter
- Carter been spending ~20 hrs a week on this project since summer
- WC original pinned message is from start of September, so let's use that as the start
    time
